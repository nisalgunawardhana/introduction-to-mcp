# Building MCP with LLMs

Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude! This guide will help you use LLMs to build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients.

## Preparing the Documentation
- Gather the full MCP documentation from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt
- Collect SDK READMEs and relevant docs
- Paste these into your LLM session for context

## Describing Your Server/Client
- Clearly specify what resources, tools, and prompts your server/client should provide
- List any external systems to integrate
- Example: "Build an MCP server that connects to a PostgreSQL database, exposes table schemas as resources, and provides tools for read-only SQL queries."

## Working with LLMs
- Start with core functionality, then iterate
- Ask for code explanations and improvements
- Test with the LLM and handle edge cases
- LLMs can help with resource management, tool definitions, prompt templates, error handling, and connection setup

## Best Practices
- Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
- Test each component before moving on
- Validate inputs and limit access for security
- Document your code for future maintenance
- Follow MCP protocol specifications

## Next Steps
- Review and test generated code
- Use the MCP Inspector tool for testing
- Connect to Claude.app or other MCP clients
- Iterate based on feedback and real usage
