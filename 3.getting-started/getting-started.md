# Getting Started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Welcome to the "Getting Started" guide for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This document will help you set up your environment and begin using MCP effectively.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with MCP, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
   - Python 3.10 or higher
   - Node.js (if you plan to use Node-based servers)

2. **Install MCP SDK**: You can install the MCP SDK using pip. Open your terminal and run:
   ```
   pip install mcp
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Create a new directory for your MCP project:
     ```
     mkdir my-mcp-project
     cd my-mcp-project
     ```
   - Initialize your project with the MCP command:
     ```
     mcp init
     ```

4. **Create Your First Server**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `06-server-demo.md` file to set up a basic server using MCP.

5. **Testing Your Setup**:
   - Once your server is running, you can test it by sending requests from a client. Refer to the `07-client-demo.md` for examples on how to create a client that interacts with your MCP server.

## Initial Setup

After installing the necessary tools and setting up your project, you can start building your applications using MCP. Make sure to check the following:

- **Configuration**: Ensure your server and client configurations are correct. Refer to the `04-architecture.md` for details on how components interact.
- **Security**: Follow the best practices outlined in `08-best-practices.md` to secure your application.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your environment set up, you can explore the following:

- **Server Demonstration**: Check out `06-server-demo.md` for a detailed walkthrough of setting up a server.
- **Client Demonstration**: Look into `07-client-demo.md` to learn how to create a client that communicates with your MCP server.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues, refer to `09-troubleshooting.md` for common problems and solutions.

Happy coding!
