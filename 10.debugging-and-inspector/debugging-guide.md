# Debugging Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integrations

Effective debugging is essential when developing MCP servers or integrating them with applications. This guide covers the debugging tools and approaches available in the MCP ecosystem.

## Debugging Tools Overview
- **MCP Inspector**: Interactive debugging interface for direct server testing
- **Claude Desktop Developer Tools**: Integration testing, log collection, Chrome DevTools
- **Server Logging**: Custom logging, error tracking, performance monitoring

## Debugging in Claude Desktop
- View server status and available tools/prompts
- Review logs: `tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- Use Chrome DevTools: Enable with `echo '{"allowDevTools": true}' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json` and open with Cmd-Opt-Shift-I

## Common Issues
- Use absolute paths in config files
- Set required environment variables in `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Check for path, config, and environment errors
- Review logs for connection problems

## Implementing Logging
- Log to stderr for local stdio transport
- Use structured logging and include context/timestamps
- Log important events: initialization, resource access, tool execution, errors

## Debugging Workflow
- Use Inspector for initial development and testing
- Monitor logs and error handling during integration
- Restart Claude Desktop for config changes, reload for server code changes

## Best Practices
- Use structured logging and error handling
- Track performance and resource usage
- Sanitize logs for sensitive data
- Provide log excerpts and config files when seeking help
