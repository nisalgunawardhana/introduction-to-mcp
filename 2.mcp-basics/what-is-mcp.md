# What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It serves as a bridge between AI applications and various data sources, enabling seamless integration and interaction.

## Purpose of MCP

MCP aims to facilitate the development of intelligent agents and complex workflows by allowing LLMs to access and utilize data from different sources. By providing a standardized method for context sharing, MCP enhances the capabilities of AI applications, making them more versatile and powerful.

## Functionality of MCP

MCP operates on a client-server architecture, where:

- **MCP Clients**: These are applications or tools that connect to MCP servers to request data or services.
- **MCP Servers**: These lightweight programs expose specific capabilities through the MCP, allowing clients to access various resources, tools, and prompts.

This architecture allows for flexibility in integrating different LLM providers and data sources, ensuring that developers can build robust applications that leverage the power of AI effectively. 

In summary, MCP is a crucial component in the evolution of AI applications, providing the necessary framework for context sharing and integration across diverse platforms and tools.
