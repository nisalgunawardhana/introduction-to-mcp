# Task 03: Exploring Advanced MCP Features

## Objective
In this task, you will explore advanced features of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and understand how to implement them in your applications.

## Instructions
1. **Review the Documentation**: Before diving into the exercises, review the relevant sections in the following files:
   - `04-architecture.md`: Understand the architecture of MCP and how different components interact.
   - `08-best-practices.md`: Familiarize yourself with best practices for implementing MCP in your projects.

2. **Exercise 1: Implementing Tools**
   - Create a new MCP server that exposes at least two tools. Use the example provided in `06-server-demo.md` as a reference.
   - Ensure that your tools can handle requests and return appropriate responses.

3. **Exercise 2: Integrating with External APIs**
   - Modify your server to integrate with an external API of your choice (e.g., a weather API).
   - Implement a tool that fetches data from this API and formats the response for the client.

4. **Exercise 3: Testing Your Implementation**
   - Use the client demo from `07-client-demo.md` to test your server.
   - Ensure that your tools are functioning correctly and returning the expected results.

5. **Documentation**
   - Document your implementation process, including any challenges faced and how you overcame them.
   - Update this task file with your findings and any additional insights gained during the exercises.
